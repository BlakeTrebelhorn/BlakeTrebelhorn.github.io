        <h3>TaeKwonDo</h3>
        <p>
            As a child I was always interested in martial arts. For my 8<sup>th</sup> birthday my parents signed me up for a TaeKwonDo class at the rec center. I attended training two times a week with testing every few months to work my way up the ranks. I participated in tournaments where I fought, broke boards, and competed in forms; a sequence of moves in which you memorize. After 4 &frac12; years I achieved the rank of 1<sup>st</sup> dan blackbelt, the first of the 10 blackbelt ranks in TaeKwonDo.

        <a id="scouting"></a>
        <h3>Scouting</h3>
        <p>
            I initially started my Boy Scouts career in Kindergarten. I joined alongside my best friend, whom I still talk to every weekend. While in Cub Scouts, the lower section of Boy Scouts, I enjoyed learning many valuable skills. I moved up through the ranks of Cub Scouts each school year unti I reached Tenderfoot, the first rank of Boy Scouts. Boy Scouting offered much more that Cub Scouting did. Some of my favorite memories include a summer of biking which ended with a 50 mile ride in a single day. Another one is going on a weeklong camp each year with all of my friends, where we swam, climbed, cooked, and much more. One of the coolest things we did was camp in sub-zero temperatures for 24 hours, which included sleeping in an igloo we made ourselves. My greatest achievement in Scouting was attaining the rank of Eagle Scout, which is an honor only 4% of Boy Scouts receive. One of the requirements for an Eagle Scout is planning and carrying out a community service project. I designed and raised funds for a new dock at the local nature reserve. The original one was over 30 years old and was sinking into the ground. The dock I designed is larger and has a bench around &frac34; of the structure.
