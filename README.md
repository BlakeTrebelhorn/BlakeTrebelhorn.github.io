## My Website

### About
This website started as a project for a class I was attending while at University. I built this website completely from scratch, without using any frameworks. The only outside source I used was [JQuery](https://jquery.com/). I have (had) my own domain, but I wanted to copy it over to GitHub once they added the GitHub Pages functionality. I was able to get my own domain name [blaketrebelhorn.me](http://blaketrebelhorn.me) for free from [NameCheap](http://nc.me). I had to tweak a lot of the website when I moved it over, such as adding my [Projects](http://blaketrebelhorn.me/projects) page and getting rid of PHP since GitHub pages is only a static website.
